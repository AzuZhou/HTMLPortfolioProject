      <h3>This is me</h3>
      <p>From a very youg age, I have had this burning passion for creating and expressing myself in many different ways. However,
        I did't know it was a necessity. Now that I am 18, I have come to realize that my art feeds my soul. Therefore, I
        do what I do. <br>I've been told that following your passion is not a good advice... fortunately I have always followed
        nothing but love. So hopefully I can serve you as an inspiration.</br>
